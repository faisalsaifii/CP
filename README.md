# Competitive Coding Setup

My setup in VSCODE where input is taken from `input.txt` and output is written into `output.txt`

> Make sure that you have the dependencies installed for each language

## Steps

- Just press `CMD + Shift + B`
- Select the lanugage of your file
- Comment out the code for other languages to skip the second step in `.vscode/tasks.json`

## Terminal Commands

```bash
python3 main.py < input.txt > output.txt
```

```bash
java Main.java < input.txt > output.txt
```
